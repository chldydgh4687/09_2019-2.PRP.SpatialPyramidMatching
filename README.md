## Reference  
This Project is based on ["Beyond Bags of Features: Spatial Pyramid Matching for Recognizing Natural Scene Categories"](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231b_spring1213/papers/CVPR06_LazebnikSchmidPonce.pdf)-_CVPR 2006_-	
and about class assignment in Pattern Recognition, School of Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering Sejong University.  	

## Project Abstract	
It is administered by gitkraken.  	
I know that how to use gitbash command. but invention spped is accelerated by new tools. This tool are very powerful in seeing the comment,branch, and error of your team. So, I will study Gitkraken and upload manual for classmates. This tool maybe easily create and delete branch and administer your team, faster than gitbash.	

reference papers.pdf is in the study folder.  	
Except for it, other things are related Project.
