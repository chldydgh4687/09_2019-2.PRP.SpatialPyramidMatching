## Project Abstract
It is administered by gitkraken.  
I know that how to use gitbash command. but invention spped is accelerated by new tools. This tool are very powerful in seeing the comment,branch, and error of your team. So, I will study Gitkraken and upload manual for classmates. This tool maybe easily create and delete branch and administer your team, faster than gitbash.
